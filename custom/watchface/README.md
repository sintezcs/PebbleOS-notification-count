# LCD 221

A watch face for the **Pebble Time 2** that imitates the look of the Casio W-221H:
a white LCD with slanted 7-segment digits, a dot-matrix weekday and a 2x2 indicator
box, between a black top bezel and bottom bezel.

Inverted colors, and 24-hour time with seconds instead of the temperature:

![Inverted colors](docs/watchface-inverted.png) ![Seconds](docs/watchface-seconds.png)

Version 1.4.1 (custom notification-count build). Pebble Time 2 only (platform
`emery`, 200x228 screen). **Requires the accompanying modified PebbleOS firmware
and its generated SDK, revision 110 (process SDK 5.0x6c).** This `.pbw` cannot run
on stock firmware, even when the new setting is off.

The Bottom bezel setting **Show notifications** is off by default.
Turn it on to replace the custom label with a notification indicator.
**Show notification number** defaults to on; switch it off to display just the icon.
**Notification icon** offers Envelope (default), Bell, and Filled dot. Viewed notifications remain counted; deleted ones
do not. Counts above 99 show `99+`. It refreshes at launch, on returning to the
face, when enabled, and every minute. Notifications removed from the phone while
the face remains visible may take up to a minute to disappear from this count.
No Android helper is required. Turning it off restores your custom label; all
existing settings are retained.

See [the implementation and verification notes](../NOTIFICATION-COUNT.md) for
source revisions, custom build commands and test evidence. The new feature was
tested with the modified firmware in QEMU; physical-device verification is
pending. The instructions below describe the original stock build unless noted.

## What it shows

| Area | Content |
|---|---|
| Top bezel | Battery level and step count, or your own text instead of either (settings) |
| Weekday | Dot-matrix day name (SUN, MON, ...) |
| Indicator box | **BT** phone connected, **CHG** charging (it becomes **FULL** once the battery is full and the watch is still on the charger), **SIG** an audible hourly chime is set, Quiet Time is off and the watch's speaker is not muted, **MUTE** Quiet Time on. Active labels are black (white when inverted); inactive ones use the same faint gray as the unlit segments |
| Time | Large 7-segment digits (slanted by default). A **P** lights up for PM in 12-hour mode |
| Date | DD-MM or MM-DD. A **DST** label above it lights while daylight saving time is in effect in your time zone |
| Right box | Temperature (°C or °F) or seconds |
| Bottom bezel | A **WR** badge (or **HR** and your latest heart rate) and a text label |

Notes:

- Battery is reported by the watch in 10% steps, so it moves 100%, 90%, 80%, ...
- Steps come from Pebble Health. Heart rate is the latest reading the watch has; it shows `--` when there is none.
- Weather is fetched by the phone from [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com) using its location, at start-up and about every 30 minutes. To save battery, the watch only asks while the temperature can be on screen (not with seconds always on), the phone is connected and the last reading is older than 25 minutes, and the phone app waits at least 5 minutes between fetches (25 minutes when the face is merely opened again). It shows `--` if the data is more than 3 hours old.
- Unlit segments are drawn as a faint ghost, like a real LCD (can be switched off).
- The Time 2's backlight is colour-capable. By default the watch face leaves it at your normal system colour, but it can tint it instead (amber like the original's LED, one of ten presets, or any of the 64 colours in the app's picker).

## Settings

Open the watch face's settings in the Pebble app. Nothing reaches the watch until you tap **Save**.
**Reset to defaults** (at the top of the page; tap it twice, so a stray tap does nothing) puts every option back to the value below (then tap Save).

| Group | Option | Choices (default first) |
|---|---|---|
| Time & date | Time format | **Follow watch** (its 12/24-hour setting), 24-hour, 12-hour |
| | Leading zero in the hour | On (07:05), Off (`7:05`, like the original). 24-hour format only; not shown while 12-hour is selected |
| | Date format | DD-MM, MM-DD |
| | Single-digit dates | **Leading zeros** (`06-05`), blank first number only (` 6-05`), or blank both numbers (` 6- 5`, like the original) |
| Right box | Right box shows | Temperature, Seconds (redraws every second: uses more battery) |
| | Temperature unit | **Follow watch** (Fahrenheit when the watch uses imperial units, otherwise Celsius), Celsius, Fahrenheit (shown while the temperature can be on screen) |
| | Seconds ticking | **Always** (every second, the default), or after a wrist shake. Shown only while the right box shows seconds; the right box shows the temperature the rest of the time |
| | Seconds duration | 30 s. 5 to 120 in steps of 5: how long the seconds tick after a shake (shown only for "After a wrist shake") |
| Top bezel | Show battery level | On. When off, the left text is shown instead |
| | Left text | `30 DAY BATT` (up to 19 characters, capitals; only shown while the battery level is off) |
| | Show step count | On. When off, the right text is shown instead |
| | Right text | `WR 3ATM` (up to 19 characters, capitals; only shown while the step count is off) |
| Bottom bezel | Show heart rate | Off. When on, the WR badge becomes HR with the latest heart rate |
| | Label | `PEBBLE` (up to 12 characters, capitals; empty for none) |
| | Show notifications | Off. Shows the notification indicator instead of the label; requires custom firmware |
| | Show notification number | On. When off, only the selected icon is visible |
| | Notification icon | Envelope, Bell, Filled dot |
| Appearance | Case color | Black, Silver |
| | Inverted colors | Off, On (light digits on a dark LCD, like a negative-display watch; the case keeps its color) |
| | Slanted digits | On, Off (leans the digits like the original; straight digits have sharper edges) |
| | Show unlit segments | On, Off |
| | Backlight color | **System default** (your watch's normal colour), Amber, Warm white, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Cyan, Blue, Purple, Pink, **Custom color...** (shows the app's own color picker, the watch's 64 colors) |
| Alerts | Vibrate on phone disconnect | Double pulse (None, Short, Long, Double, Triple, Heartbeat, SOS) |
| | Vibrate on phone reconnect | Short pulse (same patterns) |
| | Hourly chime | Off, LCD Classic (two 4096 Hz beeps, like a digital watch's hourly signal), Doorbell, Big Ben (the first bar of the full-hour Westminster chime), Super (the first bar of a well-known video-game theme), Vibration only. Played at the top of the hour while the watch face is showing; choosing a sound plays it once when you save |
| | Respect Quiet Time | On. When off, the chime is replaced by a vibration during Quiet Time, because the watch mutes its speaker then (only shown while a chime is chosen) |
| | Chime volume | 70. 5 to 100 in steps of 5 (shown while a sound is chosen) |
| | Play chime | A button (shown while a chime is chosen) that plays the chosen chime once when you tap Save, so you can hear it |

There is no vibration during Quiet Time (except the hourly chime when "Respect Quiet Time" is off). When the two top-bezel texts are both long, the right
text takes the width it needs and the left one is cut with "..." to fit.

## Building and installing

You need the Pebble command-line tool and SDK (needs Python 3.10 or newer; Python 3.13 via `uv`
is what was used, because a system Python without `ensurepip` cannot create the SDK's virtualenv):

```sh
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh          # installs uv
uv tool install pebble-tool --python 3.13
pebble sdk install latest                                # tested with SDK 4.33.1
```

Build (this also installs the JavaScript dependency, `pebble-clay`):

```sh
pebble build          # produces build/<folder name>.pbw
```

Run it in the emulator, and take a screenshot:

```sh
pebble install --emulator emery
pebble screenshot --emulator emery --no-open screenshot.png
```

Install on the real watch, from this computer, over Wi-Fi:

1. In the Pebble phone app, switch on **Developer Connection** and note the phone's IP address
   (also shown in the phone's Wi-Fi settings). Keep the app open. The phone and computer must
   be on the same network.
2. Run:

   ```sh
   pebble install --phone <phone-ip>
   ```

   "Connection refused" means Developer Connection is off (it switches off when the app is
   closed or the phone sleeps).

Or copy `build/*.pbw` to the phone and open it with the Pebble app. Allow the location permission
(for weather) and the health permission (for steps and heart rate) when asked.

## Releasing

`pebble build` leaves `build/<folder name>.pbw`. The SDK adds a debugging source map to it, and that
map (and some SDK helper comments in it) contains the path of the SDK on the build computer, which
includes your user name. For a copy you are going to share or publish, run:

```sh
python3 tools/strip_pbw.py --deny YourRealName --deny yourhost   # writes build/release.pbw
```

It drops the map, then scans every remaining file for home-directory paths and for any word you
`--deny`, and exits with an error if it finds one. The name the app shows as its author comes from
`author` in `package.json`; the copyright holder is in `LICENSE`.

## What the emulator can't check

The emulator has no Bluetooth link to a phone app, no coloured backlight, no real steps or heart
rate, and it cannot open the settings page. Those need the real watch: the connect/disconnect
vibrations, the backlight colours, live heart rate, and every control on the settings page.

## How it works

| File | What it is |
|---|---|
| `src/c/main.c` | The watch app: drawing, settings, services |
| `src/c/segments.h` | The seven 7-segment outlines (generated, see below) |
| `src/pkjs/index.js` | Phone side: weather fetch (Open-Meteo) and the settings page |
| `src/pkjs/config.js` | The settings page layout, defaults and choices (Clay) |
| `src/pkjs/custom-clay.js` | Runs on the settings page: hides options that don't apply, Reset button |
| `tools/gen_segments.py` | Regenerates `segments.h` from the 7-Segment font |
| `tools/gen_menu_icon.py` | Redraws the 25x25 menu icon (needs Pillow) |
| `tools/strip_pbw.py` | Makes a release copy of the built app with the debugging map removed, and checks it for identifying text |
| `resources/images/menu_icon.png` | The watch launcher/menu icon; separate from the Android app's preview screenshot |
| `package.json` | App metadata, permissions, and the app-message keys |

**Drawing.** Everything on the white LCD panel is rasterized straight into the framebuffer
(`draw_lcd()` in `main.c`), which allows what the normal drawing API can't:

- The digits are polygons (the segment outlines of the font, scaled to each digit's box). They are
  sheared by `LCD_SLANT` (7.5%, measured from a photo of the original) unless the "Slanted digits"
  setting is off, and, with `LCD_AA`, their slanted edges are anti-aliased using the display's dark-gray
  and light-gray shades. A pixel is only ever darkened, so neighbouring segments never eat into each
  other. Upright digits are drawn without smoothing: their edges are vertical and horizontal, so plain
  pixels are sharper than gray-fringed ones.
- Unlit segments and dots ("ghosts") are drawn with an ordered dither: a number of dots out of 16
  (`GHOST_DENSITY`, fewer in the inverted theme). Inactive indicator labels use the same colour.
- The indicator box labels are drawn with the system font and then squashed in the framebuffer to
  10 pixels tall, one letter at a time (the row dropped is from inside each letter, never from a
  horizontal bar, so every bar keeps the same thickness); "BT" is also widened.
- The weekday is a 5x5 dot matrix, upright like the original. The bezel text uses the system fonts.
- Colours come from one place, `apply_theme()`: normal (black on white) or inverted (white on black),
  each with its own ghost and label shades. The case colour is independent of the theme.

**Layout.** All positions are constants in the "Drawing" section of `main.c` (`LCD_*`, `BOX_*`,
`TIME_*`, `ROW3_*`, `DST_*`, `TEMP_X`, `BOTTOM_CAP`). There is one function per screen area
(`draw_time`, `draw_date`, `draw_temperature`, `draw_indicator_frame`, `draw_top_bezel`, ...).

**Data flow.** The phone sends the temperature as the `Temp` message, in tenths of a degree Celsius (the watch converts it to the unit shown); the watch asks for a refresh
with `RequestWeather`. Settings from the settings page arrive as messages named after the
`messageKey`s in `config.js`, are copied into the `Settings` struct and saved with `persist_write_data`.
Ticks come once a minute, or every second when seconds are shown (always, or for a chosen time after a wrist shake) and the face is in front (a notification or menu covering it drops back to one a minute). The step count is read on each minute tick, and heart rate redraws the face only when the reading changes.

## Changing things

**Look:** the layout constants above; `LCD_SLANT` (the lean when "Slanted digits" is on); `LCD_AA` (`false`
turns the smoothing of slanted digits off); `GHOST_DENSITY` and `GHOST_DENSITY_INVERTED` (higher =
brighter unlit segments; 8 is a checkerboard); `BT_WIDTHS`, `LABEL_H` and `LABEL_OFF_DENSITY_INVERTED`
for the indicator labels; and the colours themselves in `apply_theme()`.

**Adding a setting** (all five steps are needed):

1. Add the item to `src/pkjs/config.js` with a `messageKey` and a `defaultValue`.
2. Add the same key to `messageKeys` in `package.json`, then run `pebble clean` (the key
   constants are generated at build time and are stale otherwise).
3. Add a field to the `Settings` struct in `main.c` (keep its groups in the order of the settings
   page), its default in `init()`, and read it in `inbox_handler()`. A full Save arrives as one app
   message: it is about 230 bytes with plain text and over 400 with emoji in the custom texts, and
   the watch's inbox is 512 bytes (`app_message_open` in `init()`), so raise that if you add much.
4. Increase `SETTINGS_KEY`. Saved settings from the old layout are then ignored (everyone's settings
   reset once), which is safer than misreading them. The same goes for `WEATHER_KEY` and `Weather`.
5. Use the value where it is drawn or acted on.

**Menu icon and phone preview:** `menuIcon` in `package.json` supplies the watch's
launcher/menu icon. The current Android app's watchface cards instead use a
storefront screenshot URL. Its sideload path creates an entry without that URL,
so the phone preview remains blank even though this PBW contains a menu icon.
An Android app change is needed to support previews for sideloaded watchfaces.
To change the watch's menu icon, edit `tools/gen_menu_icon.py` and run it.

**Segment shapes:** `segments.h` is generated. To regenerate it:

```sh
curl -sLo /tmp/7segment.ttf https://torinak.com/font/7segment.ttf
python3 tools/gen_segments.py /tmp/7segment.ttf     # needs: pip install fonttools
```

**Checking a change without a watch:** build, install to the emulator and compare screenshots. Any
change that should not alter the picture (a refactor) can be verified by taking the same
screenshots before and after with the time, weather and settings forced to fixed values, and
comparing them pixel by pixel.
